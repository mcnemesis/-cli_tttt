Implement a Command line interpreter for the TEA language that's capable of being run on the command line using the command style:

echo INPUT | tttt 

For which INPUT could be any valid TEA program already containing its input

Or with

echo INPUT | tttt -c TEAS

Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from the string TEAS

Or with

echo INPUT | tttt -fc TEAS

Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from the file path TEAS

Or with

tttt -i INPUT -c TEAS

Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from the string TEAS

Or with

tttt -i INPUT -fc TEAS

Where INPUT is treated as input data and the TEA program is read from the file path TEAS

Or with

tttt -fi INPUT -fc TEAS

Where INPUT is treated as data input file path and the TEA program is read from the file path TEAS

In all situations, the TTTT interpreter executes the available TEA program on the available input data and outputs the final result via standard output, and does nothing else but quit.
